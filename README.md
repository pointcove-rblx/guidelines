## Section C - Social Media
Pointcove has various social media channels for others to increase interaction within the Pointcove community. However, we do have several ground rules for others interacting with these social platforms.
By joining, commenting, chatting, or interacting in any other form in any Pointcove Social Media space, you automatically agree to comply with the following rules whilst present on accounts run by Pointcove on these platforms.
### C1 - Discord (Communications) Server
Our Discord Server, or our Communications Server, is a place where others can chat, recieve support on services and products, keep up to date with the group, and conduct many other activities while on the server. Upon joining, users will be screened to agree to the rules of the server. If users fail to comply, they will receive moderation actions defined in C1B. We expect **all** users to *show good conduct* to others in the server, and utilize common sense.


#### C1A - Server Rules

1.  **Be Respectful**: Treat others with kindness and respect. Harassment, hate speech, slurs, discrimination, or any form of disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.
    
2.  **Keep It Safe**: Do not share personal information or engage in activities that compromise your safety or the safety of others. This includes distributing IP grabbers, token loggers, or fake Nitro links.
    
3.  **NSFW Prohibited**: The use of any sexual content, predatory behavior, and NSFW material is not allowed on any platform managed by Pointcove. Refrain from posting or sharing sexual content, including pornographic material, CSAM material, and suggestive phrases. Detailed guidelines are in Section Z1 of the Pointcove ECH document.
    
4.  **Spamming Prohibited**: Avoid excessive messaging, flooding, or spamming in channels. This includes text, images, emojis, or repeated content.

10.  **No Copypastas**: Excessive use of copypastas (repetitive or large blocks of text copied and pasted) is not allowed. Occasional copypastas may be permissible in moderation, but flooding channels with copypastas disrupts conversation flow and may annoy other members. Use them sparingly and considerately.
    
11.  **No Trolling or Flaming**: Do not engage in trolling, flaming, or purposefully provoking others. Keep discussions constructive and civil.

#### C1B - Infractions
When a moderator hands out an infraction to a user, they must give a valid reason for giving an infraction, and state the reason with a code first, followed by the reason. For instance:

|O1/3|Above Warning Level 1, 48-hour ban|
|O2/3|Above Warning Level 2, 168-hour ban|
|O3/3|Above Warning Level 3, Permanent ban|
|W1/1|First and only warning. The next infraction will be a more severe punishment. |
|SOV-####|Strike Override, a permban [SOV-PBAN], tempban [SOV-TBAN], kick [SOV-KICK], or hardmute [SOV-MUTE] will be carried out instantly. Administrators have the right to override the standard consequences if a situation gets out of hand.|
|MQT|Ongoing investigation, for community safety, the user will be placed in hardmute status for 730 hours.|

Users will keep their warning streak for two weeks from the first warning. If a user receives another warning in the second week of the warning streak period, the period will reset and expire two weeks after.
