### A2 - UM Guidelines
Being a Pointcove UM member is a serious responsibility. Keep in mind you are part of the management group responsible for every single operation in Pointcove. With this said, some of your responsibilities include utilizing common sense for everything and following all of the Pointcove ECH guidelines. **YOU MUST ALSO FOLLOW ALL RULES** that will be referenced below:
